This project is a web-based voting system implemented using HTML/CSS for front-end design and PHP for back-end functionality. The system utilizes the Plurality Algorithm for counting votes.

## Setup Instructions

To run this project locally, follow these steps:

### 1. Install XAMPP:

   - Download and install XAMPP from [here](https://www.apachefriends.org/index.html).
   
### 2. Start Apache and MySQL:
   - After installing XAMPP, start Apache and MySQL modules from the XAMPP Control Panel.
   
### 3. Import Database:
   - Import the provided database into your MySQL server. You can do this via phpMyAdmin, which is included in XAMPP. Create a new database and import the provided SQL file into it.

### 5. Folder Location:
   - Place the project folder containing the HTML, CSS, and PHP files inside the 'htdocs' directory of your XAMPP installation. This is typically located at `C:\xampp\htdocs` on Windows or `/Applications/XAMPP/htdocs` on macOS.

### 6. Access the Website:
   - Open a web browser and navigate to `http://localhost/your_project_folder_name` to access the voting system.

## Additional Notes

- Ensure that XAMPP's Apache and MySQL services are running whenever you want to use the voting system locally.
- Modify the database connection settings in the PHP files if necessary to match your local MySQL configuration.
- Feel free to customize the HTML/CSS files to match your desired design preferences.
